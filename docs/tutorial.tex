h1. 3. My Green Town

h2. This is the game zone:

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Selection2.jpg' width = 700 />

As you may have noticed, the gamezone is divided into smaller tiles, but with the same shape. The tile selected is marked with orange. You can select a tile by clicking on it.

To move the camera, click and hold the left mouse button when the cursor is over the gamezone, then move the mouse.

h2. The game menu

On the top of the screen there are buttons and information as following:

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Exp12.jpg' width = 700 />

The goods and money are useful for building and maintaining houses, flats and so on. There is an algorithm which calculates the score of each town, which is used in enstablishing the town ranking ( see Ranking - Login screen ).

The red color of the Goods number means that you have reached the maximum value of goods. To increase it, build Warehouses.

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Exp22.jpg' width = 700 />

Minimap is a miniature version of your town.

By holding down the left mouse button while moving the mouse over the minimap, you can also move the camera.

h2. I marked the buttons with numbers, as follows:

h3. 1. Compass

Compass changes the direction of the camera.

h3. 2. Pollution

This button changes tiles' color to green if they are fairly polluting, red marks heavy pollution and blue stands for green areas.

h3. 3. Town management

In this window you can rename your town and buy more grassland.

On the road tiles there is a chance to spawn a random type of car, which is set by the Number of cars scrollbar ( from None - 0%, to High - 20% ).

h3. 4. Statistics

Here you can see the town's general information.

h3. 5. Research center

This is available after building the Research center. This enables using several new technologies.

h3. 6. Documentation

This shows the documentation of the building placed on the selected tile ( if it has any ).

h3. 7. Task log

The tasks are going to be explained later in this tutorial.

h3. 8. Account manager

Here you can Change your username or password. Moreover, you can create a new town or delete an existent one ( Note: if you have more than one ).

h3. 9. Log out

Brings the user back to the Town selection screen.

h1. 4. Building types

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Exp32.jpg' width = 700 />

There are several types of buildings ( Houses, Energy, Economy and so on ). Clicking on one of them shows the buildings available and unavailable of that type.

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Exp42.jpg' width = 700 />

To see the description, move the cursor over the building from the building panel.

The description contains: 

* Building name;

* Population granted ( workers needed, for negative value );

* Pollution;

* Money income;

* Water needed;

* Energy required;

* Waste produced;

* Goods income;

* Score granted;

* Requirements ( Money and Goods );

h2. Now let's make some tasks.

Tasks are very useful in earning resources and in learning how to play the game.

Firstly, open the Task log.

Click on the Available button to see the available tasks. Now there is only the "Introduction" task. After clicking on the name of the task ( "Introduction" ), you will see its description and additional information, including the task's requirements.

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Quests1.jpg' width = 700 />

It is recommended to read the details, but, for impatient persons, this can be skipped and read only the requirements.

If you do not see the Claim button, scroll down and then click it.

After claiming the task, it will be moved to the "In progress" section ( to see it, click on the "In progress" button ).

To close the Task log, click again on its button.

This task requires building 5 roads. To build a road, right click on an empty tile ( grassland ) and you will notice two buttons:

* Build road

* Bulldoze ( delete building )

<img src = 'img/tutorial/Rclick.jpg' width = 700 />

Then click on the Build road button. You will notice that the grassland is replaced by a road.

After repeating this on 4 other tiles, you will complete the task.

To complete it, go back on the Task log, open the "In progress" section and scroll down to the Complete button, then press it.

Roads are required for providing connetions between buildings. Most of them cannot be built except near a road tile.

The second task requires building an Wind turbine.

Wind turbine uses wind power to produce electricity, which is further required ( like the water ) by the most buildings.

To build the turbine, click on the Energy building class and move the cursor over its image. While holding down the left mouse button, move the mouse over the desired tile ( it will be marked with orange, as a selected tile ) - drag-and-drop action. Then release the left mouse button.

This is the building procedure.

h2. Do not forget: 
* The game is very easy when following the instructions ( the tasks ).
* Your goal in this game is to build a town as ecological as possible.

h1. We wish you success and we hope that you will enjoy playing the game!
