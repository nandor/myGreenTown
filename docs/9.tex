h1. Recycling Station

The recycling station is the first part of the recycling process - it's the part you can see. At the recyclign station, the trash is sorted into many categories to make recycling possible. It is the best alternative to the garbage dump. Not only that you should try to include theese in your town, but you should also try to use them in real life too!
